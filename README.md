First, read the [Renovate minimal reproduction instructions](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/minimal-reproductions.md).

Then replace the current `h1` with the Renovate Issue/Discussion number.

## Current behavior

PostgreSQL v17 is also included as an upgrade target.

## Expected behavior

I want to keep the PostgreSQL version in my docker-compose.yaml within the range 16 <= version < 17.
